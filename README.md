## Terraform-Best-Practices

1. Automation
	- Security & Compliance
	- Validation & Formating
	- Testing
2. Version Control
3. CI/CD Automation

### Github Actions & CI/CD Integrations

#### Security and Vulnerability Scanning

Static code analysis tool for infrastructure-as-code.

##### [tfsec](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec-pr-commenter-action)

tfsec uses static analysis of your terraform templates to spot potential security issues. Now with terraform CDK support.

#####[checkhov](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov-action)

It scans cloud infrastructure provisioned using Terraform, Terraform plan, Cloudformation, Kubernetes, Dockerfile, Serverless or ARM Templates and detects security and compliance misconfigurations using graph-based scanning.

Checkov also powers Bridgecrew, the developer-first platform that codifies and streamlines cloud security throughout the development lifecycle. Bridgecrew identifies, fixes, and prevents misconfigurations in cloud resources and infrastructure-as-code files.

#### Automating Terraform Documentation using [terraform-docs](https://github.com/terraform-docs/gh-actions)

[Documentation generated by Terraform-docs](./terraform/README.md)

#### Terraform fmt and validate checks

#### Semantic Versioning hooks
TBC

### [Directory Structure. Mono VS Multi](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-mono-repo-vs-multi-repo-the-great-debate)

### DRYing out variables and input variables
    - Default values best practices -> look at helm 
    - Exiger vs sample

### Presentation #2
1. Terragrunt vs Terraform
2. Terraform vs Terraform Cloud


#### Benefits of Terraform Cloud
1. RBAC 
2. API Integration for third party applications and systems rather than service account/user based.
3. Workspaces are Collections of Infrastructure
4. Sentinel is an embeddable policy as code framework to enable fine-grained, logic-based policy decisions that can be extended to source external information to make decisions.
5. Easily leverage and integrate with Hashicorp Vault


Policy enforcement: With Sentinel, you can assign policy criteria to all Terraform plans before execution. This allows for enforcement such that only modules from the TFE private module registry can be used; this provides greater control over collaboration and adoption of company policy and/or regulatory requirements.
